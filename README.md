This is a work-in-progress for the internship I am currently doing at Carlson Wagonlit Travel. 

The purpose of this Shiny app is to replace Excel pivot table to be the main analytical tool used in our division. All the filters and summary tables are functioning, and more interactive visualizations are to be added. A csv file needs to be uploaded first at the "Data" tab in order to use the other functions of the app.
